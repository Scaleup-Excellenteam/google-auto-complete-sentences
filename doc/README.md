# Project Name

*Quick description. E.g., "A tool that analyzes fruit prices over time." (Replace with your project description)*

## Algorithms & Structures

- **Example Algorithm**: Used to analyze fruit price trends. *(This is just an example. Replace with your algorithm or data structure and its role in the code flow.)*

## Detailed Code Flow

*Start by detailing how you've set up your main data structures. E.g., "We begin by collecting fruit prices from various sources." Then, explain the core logic or algorithm. E.g., "Next, we apply the Example Algorithm to identify price spikes." Conclude with any post-processing or output generation. E.g., "Finally, we visualize the price trends on a graph."*

**Hint**: This section is just a placeholder example of fruit prices. Replace it with a clear and detailed flow of your actual project's logic, algorithms, and processe
